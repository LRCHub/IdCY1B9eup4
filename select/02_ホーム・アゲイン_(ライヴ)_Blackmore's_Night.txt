I've been many places
I've travelled 'round the world
Always on the search for something new
But what does it matter
When all the roads I've crossed
Always seem to lead back to you...

Old familiar faces
Everyone you meet
Following the ways of the land
Cobblestones and lanterns
Lining every street
Calling me to come home again

Dancing in the moonlight
Singing in the rain
Oh, it's good to be back home again
Laughing in the sunlight
Running down the lane
Oh, it's good to be back home again

When you play with fire
Sometimes you get burned
It happens when you take a chance or two
But time is never wasted
When you've lived and learned
And in time it all comes back to you...

Old familiar faces
Everyone you meet
Following the ways of the land
Cobblestones and lanterns
Lining every street
Calling me to come home again

Dancing in the moonlight
Singing in the rain
Oh, it's good to be back home again
Laughing in the sunlight
Running down the lane
Oh, it's good to be back home again

Oh, it's good to be back home again
And when I got weary
I'd sit a while and rest
Memories invading my mind
All the things I'd treasured
The ones I'd loved the best
Were the things that I'd left behind
